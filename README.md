# Thermal and burial history model of the Southern Permian Basin

An estimation of temperature in 3 km depth and vitrinite reflectance data of Upper Rotliegend are shown in two maps (JPG-files). For the estimation, a 3D model with an 1x1 km and 5x5 km grid was developed between UK and Poland (Southern Permian Basin). The stratigraphic depth data was taken from H Doornenbal, A Stevenson (2010).

If you want to get a better idea for the properties of such a model, have a look into the small chunks of model code. Alternatively, contact me or listen to my presentation at the conference STC 2017 in Celle. 

The author of the original pybasin model, on which this model is based on, shows a version with the calculation of the swiss molasse basin: "https://bitbucket.org/elcopone/pybasin".
