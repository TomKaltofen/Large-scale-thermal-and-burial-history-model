# Thermal and burial history-model of the Southern Permian Basin
Here are results and small code pieces shown of my master's thesis. 

The two JPG show examplary results of this model.

Unfortunately, I am not able to publish the changed version of the original model of pybasin. The  author of the original pybasin shows a version with the calculation of the swiss molasse basin: "https://bitbucket.org/elcopone/pybasin".
