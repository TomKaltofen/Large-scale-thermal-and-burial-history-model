# Thermal-and-burial-history-model of the Southern Permian Basin
Here are results and small code pieces shown of my master's thesis. 

The two JPG show examplary results of this model.

Unfortunately, I am not able to publish the full model. The original author of pybasin, which is the basis of the model, shows a version with the calculation of the swiss molasse basin: "https://bitbucket.org/elcopone/pybasin".
